- **Version Control**: GitHub (junksamiad account)

### Data Models
```prisma
model Child {
  id         String     @id
  recipient  String
  age        Int
  gender     String
  giftIdeas  String
  priority   Boolean
  donations  Donation[]
}

model Donation {
  id            String   @id
  childId       String
  child         Child    @relation(...)
  donorName     String
  department    String
  donationType  String   // 'gift' | 'cash'
  amount        Decimal?
  createdAt     DateTime
}
```

## Key Features

### Core Donation Flow
1. Click festive gift box on tree image
2. Choose selection method (random/filtered)
3. View child details in beautiful card
4. Select donation type (gift/cash)
5. Enter donor information
6. See confetti celebration
7. Watch leaderboard update

### Gamification Elements
- Department leaderboard with rankings
- Real-time donation counters
- Progress bars with animations
- Trophy icons for top departments
- "New donation" notifications

### Visual Polish
- Snow animation overlay
- Gift box hover effects (glow/scale)
- Smooth wizard transitions
- Confetti on successful donation
- Loading skeletons
- Responsive design

## Testing Strategy

### Story-Level Testing
- **After Each Story**: Run quality gates (lint, typecheck, build)
- **Visual Testing**: Review UI on multiple devices after Story 1.2
- **Integration Testing**: Test full flow after Story 1.4
- **Performance Testing**: Verify 60fps animations after Story 1.5

### Sprint-Level Testing
- Complete end-to-end donation flow
- Test on mobile and desktop browsers
- Verify department statistics accuracy
- Load test with concurrent donations
- Accessibility spot checks

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and follows conventions
- [ ] TypeScript builds without errors
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] Tested on Chrome, Safari, mobile
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Animation performance on mobile | Test early, optimize or reduce if needed |
| Database connection issues | Implement retry logic, connection pooling |
| Real-time updates overwhelming server | Use SWR deduplication, consider caching |
| Airtable data migration fails | Create backup, validate after migration |

## Timeline
- **Duration**: 5 development days
- **Story Sequence**: 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 → 1.5
- **Checkpoints**: After Story 1.2 (UI review) and 1.4 (integration test)

## Next Sprint Preview
Sprint 2 will add:
- Admin dashboard with statistics
- Email notifications
- Advanced filtering options
- Department goals/targets
- Export functionality

## Notes
- Departments are hardcoded: Marketing, Sales, Accounts
- Individual donor names never shown publicly
- Polling interval (5 seconds) provides "live enough" updates
- Focus on polish and user delight over feature quantity
